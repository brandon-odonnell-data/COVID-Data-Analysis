# COVID-Data-Analysis
Tools and Languages: SQL, SQL Server, Excel

Description and Intent: This project uses real COVID-19 data from countries across the world, provided by Our World in Data, with some guidance taken from YouTuber Alex the Analyst. Beginning with some initial review and preparation of figures stored in Excel spreadsheets, I imported the data into SQL Server and went through a general exploration of the data at country and global levels. SQL techniques employed included Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions and Creating Views.

Insights and Reporting: Although facts and figures were widely reported in the news, they were most often presented in the context of your country of residence. It was interesting to compare the infection and death rates across multiple countries and within each continent, especially when considering their locations and populations. The data's location links to country and continent enabled interesting small and large scale analyses, but also presented difficulties making various calculations; techniques such as subqueries proved useful workarounds, but the data could benefit from some additional manipulation prior to full analysis in order to provide multi-level drill down capability in Power BI or other visualisation applications.
